************************************
UI support to create and manage Kubernetes cluster for the user (Phase-3)
************************************

Fiware Lab user will be able to create and manage kubernetes cluster through UI. User can also deploy Fiware GEs over kubernetes cluster by selecting the GEs from the catalogue provided in GUI.

User will be provided with the code to setup flask server to enable GUI from web browser. After the setup, user can access UI through http://<VMâ€™s Public IP>:<port number> on Web browser. User will get a login screen. For the very first time, user need to register himself through Register option and after that he can login to the server.

After successful login a Dashboard will appear where user will get options to create and manage kubernetes cluster and deploy Fiware GEs.
