# Contributions

We welcome contributions and value your ideas. Please use GitHub Issues
if you would like to suggest ideas, request new features or enhancements,
or report bugs. To contribute code, open a GitHub Pull Requests. If you
are new to the project, we kindly ask you to review FIWARE's [contribution
requirements][fiware-contrib].

## To contribute code:

1. Fork the repository and clone the fork to your local development environment
1. Identify a modular contribution to the code (avoid too large contributions
    to simplify review)
1. Create a branch in your repository where you tackle the "modular
contributions"
    - For multiple contributions tackling different functionalities, create
      different branches
    - For all the new functionalities provide tests (see `setup_dev_env.sh`
      and `run_tests.sh` in the root to understand how tests can be run locally)
1. Wait for the review
    - Implement required changes
    - Repeat until approval
1. Done :) You can delete the branch in your repository.
