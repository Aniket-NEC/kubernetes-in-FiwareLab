Creating a new instance with K8s UI supported Image
************************************

Steps to create a new instance from our newly created image:

1. Go to Instances page and click on Launch Instance:

.. figure:: figures/instance.png


2. Select the Snapshot from Source while creating a new Image:

.. figure:: figures/launch_instance.png


**Note:** Make sure that the flavor of the instance booted is at least equal to or bigger than the size of the image.
